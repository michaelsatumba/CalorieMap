## Overview

# CalorieMap
# CSC780 Final Project
## _Calorie Map_
by Michael Satumba and Jarrett Zapata

## Proposal
An app that tracks calories expended given a point a to point b like google maps

## Must Have Features

- Inputting one address that gives you an output of calories expended from your current location
